# DroughtSens-BRTs
BRT models for drivers of regional PNW drought

BRT_00_Setup.R loads packages, data, defines explanatory variables

BRT_01_VarCheck.R checks collinearity of variables (don't have to run each time)

BRT_04_All_Models_inclSummaries.R runs all the models and summarizes outputs (_03 versions in zretired folder did those processes separately)

BRT_05_PlotvarInf_AllDroughts.R generates curves
